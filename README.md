### AI Hint Generation Process

```javascript
// Word sent to Gemini API
Input: "ELEPHANT"

// Gemini generates contextual hint
Output: "A large mammal with a trunk and tusks, 
         known for its excellent memory"

// Hint displayed to Player 2 (word never revealed)
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Gemini API Key** (Get it from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adarshrai03/Hangman.git
   cd Hangman
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. **Open in browser**
   ```
   Navigate to http://localhost:5173
   ```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The production-ready files will be in the `dist/` folder.

## 🎮 How to Play

### Step 1: Player 1 Setup
1. Enter a secret word in the password-protected input field
2. Click **"Submit"** to send the word to the AI
3. Wait for the Gemini API to generate a hint

### Step 2: Player 2 Guessing
1. Read the AI-generated hint carefully
2. Observe the blank dashes representing each letter
3. Click letters on the on-screen keyboard to make guesses
4. **Correct guess**: Letter appears in all correct positions
5. **Wrong guess**: Part of the hangman is drawn

### Step 3: Win or Lose
- **Win**: Guess all letters before the hangman is complete
- **Lose**: Make 6 wrong guesses and the hangman is fully drawn
- Click **"Play Again"** to start a new round

## 💡 Technical Highlights

### 1. **Gemini API Integration**

```javascript
// Simplified example of API call
const generateHint = async (word) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/models/gemini-pro:generateContent', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${GEMINI_API_KEY}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      prompt: `Generate a hint for the word "${word}" without using the word itself.`
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.hint;
};
```

### 2. **React State Management**

```javascript
// Game state management
const [gameState, setGameState] = useState({
  word: '',
  hint: '',
  guessedLetters: [],
  wrongGuesses: 0,
  gameStatus: 'setup' // setup, playing, won, lost
});
```

### 3. **Smart Letter Validation**

```javascript
// Prevents duplicate guesses and validates input
const handleGuess = (letter) => {
  if (guessedLetters.includes(letter)) return;
  
  const isCorrect = word.includes(letter);
  setGuessedLetters([...guessedLetters, letter]);
  
  if (!isCorrect) {
    setWrongGuesses(wrongGuesses + 1);
  }
};
```

### 4. **Responsive Keyboard Component**

```javascript
// Dynamic keyboard with disabled state for used letters
const Keyboard = ({ onGuess, guessedLetters }) => {
  const alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.split('');
  
  return (
    <div className="keyboard">
      {alphabet.map(letter => (
        <button
          key={letter}
          disabled={guessedLetters.includes(letter)}
          onClick={() => onGuess(letter)}
        >
          {letter}
        </button>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 💬 Interview Talking Points

**When discussing this project in interviews:**

### 1. **AI Integration Expertise**
*"I integrated Google's Gemini API to generate contextual hints, demonstrating my ability to work with cutting-edge AI technologies. I implemented proper error handling, loading states, and API key security through environment variables."*

### 2. **Problem-Solving: Prompt Engineering**
*"One challenge was ensuring the AI never revealed the actual word in hints. I solved this through careful prompt engineering, instructing the model to generate descriptive clues without using the target word or its variations."*

### 3. **State Management**
*"I managed complex game state including guessed letters, wrong attempts, game status, and AI-generated hints using React hooks. This required careful consideration of state updates and their effects on UI rendering."*

### 4. **User Experience Design**
*"I designed a two-player flow where Player 1 enters the word in a password field to maintain secrecy, then the game transitions to a new screen for Player 2. This required thinking about state persistence and navigation flow."*

### 5. **Modern Development Practices**
*"I used Vite instead of Create React App for faster development experience and optimized builds. The project demonstrates modern React patterns, clean component architecture, and proper separation of concerns with services and utilities folders."*

### 6. **Asynchronous Programming**
*"The project extensively uses async/await for API calls, with proper error handling and loading states. I ensure users get feedback during API calls and gracefully handle failures without breaking the game flow."*

### 7. **Scalability Considerations**
*"The modular component structure makes it easy to add features like difficulty levels, word categories, or multiplayer functionality. The game logic is separated from UI components, making testing and maintenance straightforward."*
