### About Game
Hangman - Two Player AI-Powered Word Guessing Game , Hangman is a classic word-guessing game with a modern twist!
In this version, the game is designed for two players and includes AI-generated hints using the Gemini API.

### 🎮 How it work
1. Player 1 enters a secret word (in hidden/password format) and clicks Submit.
2. That word is sent to Gemini AI, which generates a short, easy-to-understand hint without using the word itself.
3. The game then moves to a new screen where Player 2 sees:
    - The hint
    - A series of blank dashes for each letter
    - An on-screen keyboard to start guessing!
4. With each wrong guess, the hangman figure begins to appear.
5. Guess the word correctly to win, or get the man hanged after too many wrong tries!
